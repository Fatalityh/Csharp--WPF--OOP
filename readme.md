A program that you can use for adding, deleting and updating your games onto a local database using a nice GUI.


Built using C# .Net

Frontend is built using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) which is basically a GUI (Graphical User Interface) for Windows.
Backend is built in OOP and uses a local Database to store the data that is accessed by the Frontend program.

Basically a CRUD program built using C# but actually seperating the two programs. You can use your own database and skip the Backend completely, you would have to change the frontend database connection.
